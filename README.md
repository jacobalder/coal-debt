This project was prepared as a term paper for Indiana University, O’Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs R626, Energy Justice and Policy Seminar, taught by Dr. Sanya Carley.

Abstract: In 2019, three states passed new ratepayer-backed debt securitization legislation to allow utilities to accelerate the retirement of uneconomic coal plants. More states have followed. Enacted bills differ, both in scope and focus, but select few require that securitization bonds also assist workers and communities affected by the energy transition. With coal in decline, more plants will be forced to retire and states have an opportunity––indeed a responsibility––to aid frontline communities.
